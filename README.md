Advent 2023

Day 1:

Straight forward for part 1, part 2 required realizing that reading comprehension is hard and overlapping numbers still parse correctly sevenine = 79 and not 7ine

Day 2:

Mostly a Parsing problem, how well can you parse the input and keep track.  Use RE again.

Day 3:

brute forcing part 2 as you can iterate the valid configurations

Day 4:

That's a lot of scratchers, just multiply loop through to count.

Day 5:

Need to calculate intervals

Day 6:

Gimme problem, super easy and can brute force, even though it's parabolas calculations.  Could have done half the work once you found the peak.  Oh yeah, learned to use python's progressbar2 for fancy graphics.  https://medium.com/pythoniq/progress-bars-in-python-with-progressbar2-da77838077a9

Day 7:

Use classes that's it.  Straight forward



Unfinished:

Day 3 part 2, need to iterate through valid configs
Day 5 part 2, need to write the range class to track ranges
