Advent 2023

Day 1:

Straight forward for part 1, part 2 required realizing that reading comprehension is hard and overlapping numbers still parse correctly sevenine = 79 and not 7ine

Day 2:

Mostly a Parsing problem, how well can you parse the input and keep track.  Use RE again.

Day 3:

brute forcing part 2 as you can iterate the valid configurations

Day 4:

That's a lot of scratchers

Day 5:

Need to calculate intervals

Day 6:

Gimme problem, super easy and can brute force, even though it's parabolas calculations.  Could have done half the work once you found the peak.
